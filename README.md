## Getting started

### Using `pixi`

An easy way to get started is to use `pixi` for the environment management.
Alternatively, you can use `conda` or `pip` to install the required packages as shown
in the sections below. Refer to [following link](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation)
for installing `pixi`.

Once `pixi` installed, you just start `jupyterlab`:

```bash
pixi run jupyter lab
```
